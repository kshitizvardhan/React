# What is npm run build ??

Actually, npm run build typically doesn't directly compile or transpile code into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead, it's commonly used as a command to trigger a build process defined in the project's package.json file.

In many JavaScript projects, especially those using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, the build process involves several steps, such as:

Transpilation: Converting modern JavaScript code (ES6+ syntax) into a version of JavaScript that is compatible with older browsers using tools like Babel.

Bundling: Combining multiple JavaScript files (and possibly CSS files) into a single file (or a few files) to reduce the number of HTTP requests required to load a web page. This is often done using bundlers like webpack or Rollup.

Minification: Removing unnecessary characters (such as whitespace and comments) from the code to reduce file size and improve load times.

Optimizations: Applying various optimizations to the code and assets (such as image compression, code splitting, tree shaking) to improve performance.

Output: Generating the final HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are ready to be deployed to a web server or served to clients.

So "npm run build" doesn't directly compile code into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a common command used to trigger the entire build process that ultimately generates these files.
