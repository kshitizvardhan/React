In a React application, tasks such as creating DOM elements, updating the DOM based on state changes, and handling dynamic data fetching from a server are typically taken care of by React itself.

React abstracts away much of the manual DOM manipulation and provides a declarative way to define UI components and manage their state. With React, you define UI components using JSX syntax, which looks similar to HTML but is actually JavaScript. React components manage their own state and automatically re-render when the state changes. This simplifies the process of building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

React also provides lifecycle methods and hooks (in functional components) that allow you to perform tasks like fetching data from a server, updating the state, and rendering UI components in response to various events.

Overall, React streamlines the development process by handling many common tasks involved in building web applications, making it easier to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code. And reduced the load of frontend devs
